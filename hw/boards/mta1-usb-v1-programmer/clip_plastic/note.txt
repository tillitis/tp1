There are two versions of the case plastic:

MTA1: Used for the OSFC sample PCBs (MTA1)

TK1: Used for Acrab/Bellatrix production PCBs (TK1)
- This version has a slightly wider opening, to accomodate the slightly wider PCBs. Existing prints were made using green plastic, to distinguish them from the MTA variant.
